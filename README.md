# ImageFusionGuidedFiltering

This project implements the "Image fusion with guided filtering" code described in the article of Shutao Li, Member, Xudong Kang, and Jianwen Hu and available here : https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/MVA/Projets2021/FocusFusion/fusion.pdf

Abstract of the article : A fast and effective image fusion method is proposed
for creating a highly informative fused image through merging
multiple images. The proposed method is based on a two-scale
decomposition of an image into a base layer containing large
scale variations in intensity, and a detail layer capturing small
scale details. A novel guided filtering-based weighted average
technique is proposed to make full use of spatial consistency
for fusion of the base and detail layers. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art
performance for fusion of multispectral, multifocus, multimodal,
and multiexposure images.
